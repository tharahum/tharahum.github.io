Tharahum is a Manjeshwaram based charity foundation, setup to resolve the socio-economic issues in the region.

When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: Sadaqah Jariyah (ceaseless charity); a knowledge which is beneficial, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him (for the deceased)

According to Prophet's words, we are trying to groom a society, which encourages Sadaqah, educates underpreviliged kids, and nurtures the next generation of ummah imbibed with virtuous qualities.


We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.‚Äù Winston Churchill
